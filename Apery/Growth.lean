# Growth of the normaliser (Proposition 5.2, in the form needed here)

`log m_K ≤ (A_eff + ε) K²` for all large `K`, with `A_eff = 1.36 < -U`.

The bound assembles the four prime ranges:

* small primes `p ≤ K/400`: `(6λ/400)K²` by the prime number theorem;
* `K/400 < p ≤ K/20`: the tail bound, `≤ -0.05346 K²`;
* `K/20 < p ≤ K/3`: the exact table, `(5.18) K² = 0.04279 K²`;
* `K/3 < p ≤ 2h`: the outer table, `129101/96000 K² = 1.34480 K²`;

total `≈ 1.3480 K² + o(K²)`.
